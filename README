This is just a simple demo that I put together in effort to learn how to build a curses based app.

Running:
  python curses_demo.py


That should bring up a window that has "This is a test" centered in it.

You should be able to resize the window, and use the arrow keys to move the text around the window.

BEWARE:
  By default, if your cursor moves outside of the screen boundaries the program will terminate.

License: 
  No license. I hope someone can learn from this.
